You are required to write a python function that takes a list of SMS messages and input and returns a ranking of each words frequency.
Example:
input = ['hi there, how are you', 'are you coming for lunch tonight']
output = {'hi': 1, 'there': 1, 'how': 1, 'are': 2, 'you': 2, 'coming': 1, 'for': 1, 'lunch': 1, 'tonight': 1}
You should test your program with input of your choice. Make sure the code is readable, reusable, and scalable
